# Balena VS Code (pre-alpha)

This is an unofficial VS Code extension for use with Balena SDK and CLI. It aims to provide features such as:
- Connecting to a fleet and listing contained devices
- Online/offline statuses and metadata per device
- Opening device SSH sessions in the integrated terminal
- Dropping devices into local mode
- Modifying fleet and device level environment variables
- Opening and following device logs in a new tab
- Managing and pushing releases 

It is an extremely early work-in-progress. Highly advised not to use unless doing extension development.
